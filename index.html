<h2>Workshops and Performances</h2>

<h3>Creativity Through Mask Making</h3>
<small>11am - 1pm</small>
<p>
This workshop offers a facilitated experience using mask making as a tool for reflection on the process of the person as inventor and innovator of self. The workshop uses creativity to explore and critically discuss the challenges and leaning issues that arise in the life/work environment. Participants will have the opportunity to make a mask, be involved in understanding the process of this therapeutic creative approach and discuss the output.
</p>

<h3>Innovation Through Lego Play</h3>
<small>11am - 1pm</small>
<p>
  <i>
    Our Lego Serious Play experiences at NUI Galway resulted in increased creativity in terms of our approach to design, it also facilitated the advancement of our new product design process. I look forward to the Innovation at Play Symposium, engaging with other R&amp;D leaders and I wish Mary and her team continued success with the Symposium

<h3>Story Telling Through Sound</h3>
<small>11am - 1pm</small>
<p>
  During this workshop we shall be using various ordinary, everyday items to create a myriad of sounds that can be used to imbue story with a richer, more coherent narrative; so much so that words are no longer necessary to tell the story. As part of this workshop we shall explore how once differing sounds are placed together, the mind can perceive them to infer different meanings. For example a piece of cellophane can be used to make the sound of ice creaking, the flames of a fire, or the sound of a bone about to be broken. A lot of the techniques demonstrated are used by foley artists around the world in the sound design for the film, game design and radio drama industries.
</p>

<h3>Innovation through Performance: a Practice-based workshop</h3>
<small>11am - 1pm</small>
<p>
  This workshop explores how participants can use theatre skills to inspire and foster creativity in themselves and the people they work with. We will consider how play, improvisation, and other rehearsal techniques have applications in the worlds of education, business and beyond. No acting skills or experience are needed.
</p>

<h3>Ada.Ada.Ada</h3>
<small>2pm</small>
<p>
  Ada Lovelace wrote the world’s first complex algorithm in 1843 and then was written out of history. In the performance, Ada.Ada.Ada, Lovelace tells her story using an LED dress which she operates – live on stage – using her wearable tech satin glove. Ada.Ada.Ada exists to help people, especially girls and women, engage with technology and stem as a career.
